							<div class="tab-pane" id="list-sequences">

							</div>
							<div class="tab-pane" id="list-data">
								Understand and use the terms "population" and "sample"
								<hr>
								Use samples to make informal inferences about the population
								<hr>
								Understand and use sampling techniques (simple random, stratified, systematic, quota, opportunity)
								<hr>
								Select or critique sampling techniques in the context of solving a statistical problem, including understanding that different samples can lead to different conclusions about the population
								<hr>
								Interpret diagrams for single variable data (histograms, frequency polygons, box and whisker and outliers, cumulative frequency), including understanding that area in a histogram represents frequency
								<hr>
								Connect to probability distributions
								<hr>
								Interpret scatter diagrams and regression lines for bivariate data, including recognition of scatter diagrams which include distinct sections of the population. Students should be familiar with the terms explanatory and response variables.

								<hr>
								Understand informal interpretation of correlation ("positive", "negative", "zero", "strong", "weak") and that correlation does not equal causation
								<hr>
								Interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variation (variance, standard deviation, range, interpercentile ranges). Use of linear interpolation to calculate percentiles from grouped data is expected.
								<hr>
								Be able to calculate standard deviation, including from summary statistics
								<hr>
								Recognise and interpret possible outliers in data sets and statistical diagrams. Any rule needed to identify outliers will be specified.
								<hr>
								Select or critique data presentation techniques in the context of a statistical problem

							<div class="tab-pane" id="list-probability">
								Understand and use mutually exclusive and independent events when calculating probabilities. Venn/tree diagrams may be used. Set notation to describe events may be used.
								<hr>
								Link to discrete and continuous distributions. Students should understand that area under the curve represents probability in the case of a continuous distribution.
								<hr>
								Understand and use conditional probability, including the use of tree/venn diagrams and two-way tables

								<hr>
								Select an appropriate probability distribution for a context with appropriate reasoning, including recognising when the binomial or normal model may not be appropriate
								<hr>
								Understand and apply the language of statistical hypothesis testing, developed through a binomial model: null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, significance level, test statistic, 1 tail test, 2 tail test, critical value, critical region, acceptance region, p value;
								<hr>
								extend to correlation coefficients as measures of how close data points lie to a straight line (students should know that the product moment correlation coefficient \(r\) satisfies \(|r|\leq 1\) and that a value of \(r=\pm1\) means the data points all lie on a straight line)

								<hr>
								Understand that a sample is being used to make an inference about a population and appreciate that the significance level is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis
